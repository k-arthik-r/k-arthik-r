<p> <i>
#" Hi, I'm Karthik, a self-proclaimed coding wizard with a knack for turning coffee into code (and sometimes, even functional code). By day, I'm a Software Engineer, diving into Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cloud Technology, and Computer Networks. By night, Iâ€™m probably still coding, but with a side of snacks and a playlist that makes my keyboard sound like itâ€™s part of a band.

Iâ€™m a polyglot programmer, which means I speak many programming languages â€” not just JavaScript or Python, but also "badly in C++" and "confused in SQL." I love learning new things (when it doesnâ€™t involve debugging a 3AM error), and I approach challenges like a game of Tetris: sometimes things donâ€™t fit, but eventually, they will, and Iâ€™ll be singing when it all falls into place.
